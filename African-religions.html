                    <h4> African Religious Landscape</h4>
                    <p>Africa has a diverse and multi-layered religious landscape. The oldest belief systems are Traditional African Religions (TARs), which vary by ethnic group but often include ancestor worship, ritual ceremonies, and belief in a supreme creator and lesser spirits. These religions emphasize harmony with nature, community rituals, and spiritual intercession through priests or diviners.

                    Islam spread into North Africa as early as the 7th century through trade and conquest, eventually dominating regions of North, West, and East Africa. Islamic culture shaped cities like Timbuktu and Zanzibar and gave rise to Sufi brotherhoods that remain active today.

                    Christianity arrived in Ethiopia in the 4th century, giving rise to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, one of the oldest Christian institutions in the world. Christianity also spread widely through colonial missionaries in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to the growth of Catholic, Protestant, and African Independent Churches that blend biblical teachings with indigenous beliefs.

                    Modern Africa sees a coexistence of Islam, Christianity, and traditional beliefs, often blended in unique ways. There are also communities of Bah√° º√≠s, Hindus, and non-religious individuals, especially in cosmopolitan cities. Despite changes, religion remains central to African life, shaping politics, festivals, values, and social behavior.</p>
