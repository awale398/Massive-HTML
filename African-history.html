             <h3>Afican History</h3>
             <p>Small introduction</p>
             <p>Africa is the birthplace of humanity, with early hominids appearing around 4.4 million years ago, eventually evolving into Homo sapiens. By 5000 BCE, agriculture had begun in Egypt, and rich civilizations flourished—most notably Egypt, Kush, Carthage, and the Nok culture. The medieval age saw the rise of influential empires such as Ghana, Mali, Songhai, Kanem-Bornu, Ifé, Benin, Axum, Great Zimbabwe, and prosperous Swahili city-states along the coast. From the 15th century, European arrival, notably by the Portuguese, ushered in the trans-Saharan and Atlantic slave trades. The 19th century's Mfecane triggered upheaval in southern Africa, while the Scramble for Africa led to colonial partition formalized by the 1884-85 Berlin Conference. Following resistance movements—including Kenya's Mau Mau—African nations embarked on a wave of decolonization in the mid-20th century. The 1963 founding of the OAU, later the African Union, marked a new era. Post-1980s, Africa witnessed the end of apartheid, economic growth, the rise of pan-Africanism, and faced modern challenges like political instability, climate change, and development.</p>
             <h3>Pre-Colonial Africa</h3>
             <p>Africa is widely regarded as the cradle of humankind, with early hominid fossils discovered in regions such as Ethiopia and Kenya. Ancient Egypt emerged along the Nile River around 3100 BCE, giving rise to one of the world's most influential civilizations. Sub-Saharan Africa also developed sophisticated societies such as the Kingdom of Kush, Great Zimbabwe, the Ghana Empire, Mali (notably during Mansa Musa’s reign), Songhai, Benin, and Axum. These civilizations excelled in trade, science, governance, architecture, and art. The Swahili coast thrived through Indian Ocean trade, and cultural centers like Timbuktu became renowned for Islamic scholarship.</p>
             <h3>Colonial Africa</h3>
             <p>The 19th century marked the start of widespread European colonization. Following the 1884-85 Berlin Conference, Africa was arbitrarily divided among European powers, with little regard for ethnic or cultural boundaries. Colonial rule brought forced labor, resource extraction, taxation, and European-style education systems. Africans resisted colonial rule through revolts, armed resistance (like the Zulu wars, Maji Maji uprising), and later, political activism. Despite colonial oppression, many Africans formed early nationalist movements to reclaim their independence and identity.</p>
             <h3>Post-independence Africa</h3>
             <p>om 1957 (Ghana) onward, African nations gained independence. The 1960s are often called the "Year of Africa" due to the large number of countries becoming sovereign. Post-independence Africa faced complex challenges: political instability, civil wars, military coups, and neo-colonial economic systems. However, there were also major strides in nation-building, education, infrastructure, and diplomacy. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was formed in 1963, later evolving into the African Union (AU). Today, Africa is undergoing digital transformation, youth empowerment, regional integration (AfCFTA), and remains rich in culture, creativity, and resilience.</p>
