                <h2>Famous African Personalities (Non-Presidents)</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Africa has produced countless influential figures outside the political arena. In literature, Chinua Achebe of Nigeria transformed global perceptions of Africa with his groundbreaking novel Things Fall Apart. In environmental activism, Wangari Maathai of Kenya became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in reforestation and women's empowerment.

                    Trevor Noah, a South African comedian, rose from apartheid-era Soweto to become the host of The Daily Show, offering global political satire with African perspective. In sports, Didier Drogba not only excelled in football but also brokered peace during C√¥te d'Ivoire's civil war. Actress Lupita Nyong'o, with roots in Kenya and Mexico, made history as an Oscar winner and a global advocate for representation.

                    The music world reveres Miriam Makeba, who used her voice to campaign against apartheid. Meanwhile, Kofi Annan, though not a head of state, became one of the most respected diplomats globally as the UN Secretary-General. Historically, Yaa Asantewaa, an Ashanti queen mother, led an armed resistance against British colonizers in the early 1900s. Scholars like Cheikh Anta Diop challenged Eurocentric narratives and reclaimed African history. In athletics, Caster Semenya has dominated middle-distance running while courageously fighting gender discrimination.</p>
